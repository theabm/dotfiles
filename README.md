# My Dotfiles 
Hi! Since 2023 I have begun to migrate my desktop environment to NixOS. 

Currently I am using: 

- OS: NixOS 
- Package Manager: Nix
- Desktop: Hyprland 
- Editor: Neovim (through NixVim)
- Terminal Emulator: Kitty 
- Shell: Fish

Hopefully this can help some new users like myself :)
